Testing out some ideas on terrain generation.


`gen_terrain.sh` will create the heightmap and color images and leave them in `maps/`.
You can then run `animations/run.sh` to create an mp4 video of the terrain.


The folder `animations` which is used to generate a video of a fly by from the terrain is based on VoxelSpace code.
